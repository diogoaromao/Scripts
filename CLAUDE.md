# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal scripts repository that currently contains only a basic README.md file. The repository appears to be in its initial state and does not contain any code files, build configurations, or development tools yet.

## Current State

- Repository contains only a README.md with the title "Scripts"
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency management files
- No source code files (.py, .js, .ts, .sh, etc.)
- No build, test, or lint configurations
- Git repository initialized with initial commit

## Development Notes

Since this is an empty scripts repository, future development will likely involve:
- Adding various utility scripts in different languages
- Each script may have its own dependencies and execution requirements
- Consider adding a consistent structure as scripts are added
